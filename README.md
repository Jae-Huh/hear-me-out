# Hear Me Out

Built by [Jae Huh](https://github.com/Jae-Huh), this project was created to help patients in hospital, who are experiencing difficulties communicating due to their conditions.

Hear Me Out offers a default communication board that has basic patient needs with an ability to add customised boards the user can create. When a button that includes an icon and a corresponding word is pressed, the user can hear the word.
